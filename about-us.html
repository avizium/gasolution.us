                    In 2014, Mr. John Chea Davies, founded Global Alliance Solutions, LLC. His vision has since been, as imbedded in our Mission Statements, to form a group that does not only distinguished itself in special ways, but simply walking in the shoes of its clients; providing professional services with a flavor of dedication, passion, diligence and empathy; 'striving for excellence to exceed clients' expectations'. Within two years in business, our firm acquired and maintained a happier pool of clientele (over 1250 clients, individuals and corporations). The firm created and implemented its signature 'Global Referral Program (GRP)' opening fundraising opportunities for people and non-profit organizations around the world to raise funds for various humanitarian causes during the United States tax return seasons (January thru April), an innovation, or better still, an achievement that evidently distinguished the firm and helped us acquire and maintain competitive edge over our competitors in the industry within a relatively short period of time, which is seen by experts in the business as a notable feat for a small firm. On the first year of the GRP (2016 Tax Season), the firm paid out referral fees and matched contributions to humanitarian causes to the tone of $112,500.00 worldwide. This amount is expected to quadruple this current 2017 tax season. In addition, the firm has grown its clientele and making headway in serving clients in all 50 states not only in the area of individual and corporate taxation services, but also with the other deliverables: Book Keeping and Accounting, Management and Business Compliance Services, Strategic Management Solutions and International Expansion Strategies. Staffed with qualified and experienced tax professionals, and proficient with state-of-the-art technologies in this environment, we have cultivated a culture for providing and delivering professional services online (including filing our clients tax returns) in a highly secured and encrypted environment with ZERO percent chance of compromising client confidentiality; mitigating risk without subjecting or inconveniencing clients with the burden and costs of traveling to our offices or waiting long agonizing hours for services. Because we recognize and value clients' time and space, we have developed this culture to work effectively and efficiently with them (clients) from the comfort of their home and at their convenience. We are available to work with clients, 24/7 across various time-zones in the United States. The 'Promotion' page on his website illustrates step by step actions our clients or potential clients are allowed to take in order to facilitate execution of our online services.
